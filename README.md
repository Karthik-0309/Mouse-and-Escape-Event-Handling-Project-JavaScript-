# ðŸªŸ Modal Window using JavaScript (Mouse & Escape Key Event Handling)

This is a simple project that demonstrates how to open and close a modal window using JavaScript. The modal can be triggered using mouse clicks and closed using the Escape key.

- Opens a popup modal when you click a button.
- Closes the modal when:
  - You click the close (Ã—) button.

  - You press the Escape key on your keyboard.

## ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used

## âœ… Features
